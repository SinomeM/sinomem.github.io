# Simone Montalbano

Hi! I am Simone Montalbano and this is my personal web page.

I am a researcher in Genomic Psychiatry, my current main research
interest is on methods to call, characterize and validate CNVs
(Copy Number Variants) form SNP array and NGS data.   
This is my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9846-0560) page.

## Interests

- lorem ipsum


## Education

- I have a Master of Science degree in Cellular and Molecular Biotechnologies,
  I graduated at the University of Trento, Italy, in 2019;

- I did my Bachelor, in Biotechnologies, at the University of Padova, Italy.


## Research Experience

- I am currently a Research Assistant at the Research Institute of Biological
  Psychiatry ([IBP](https://biopsyk.dk/)) at Roskilde, Denmark. I recently started
  a PhD track at the University of Copenhagen ([KU](https://www.ku.dk/english/));

- I have worked as pre-doc fellow for one year (for January 2020 to January 2021)
  in the laboratory of
  [Neurogenomic Biomarkers](https://www.cibio.unitn.it/302/laboratory-of-neurogenomic-biomarkers)
  at CIBIO, Trento, Italy. Here I also did the internship for the Master Thesis 
  (approximately 8 months).


## Projects

- I am the author and maintainer of the R/Bioconductor package
  [CNVgears](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/CNVgears/). The aim is to
  provide a framework to easily integrate and analyze CNV (Copy Number Variants)
  calling results from multiple algorithms and data sources.


## Hobbies

These area some of my main hobbies from the present and the past:

- I am an amateur trail/road runner as well as a road cyclist;
- On my bicycles I like to do all the maintenance work etc. myself,
  in some I am way an amateur mechanic;
- I really enjoy video games since I was quite young;
- I studied sound synthesis and engineering as a side project for
  a couple of years. Everything is paused since some time but I hope
  to get my hands on some synthesizers again at some point in the future;
- I have a minor passion for mechanical keyboards;
