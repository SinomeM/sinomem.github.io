Hi! I am Simone Montalbano and this is my personal web page.

## Education 

## Research Experience

- I am currently a Research Assistant at the Research Institute of Biological
  Psychiatry ([IBP](https://biopsyk.dk/)) at Roskilde, Denmark. I recently started a PhD track at the 
  University of Copenhagen ([KU](https://www.ku.dk/english/));

  [Neurogenomic Biomarkers](https://www.cibio.unitn.it/302/laboratory-of-neurogenomic-biomarkers)
  at CIBIO, Trento, Italy. Here I also did the intership (approxmately 8 months) for the Master 
  Thesis;

## Projects

- I am the author and mantainer of the R/Bioconductor package
  [CNVgears](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/CNVgears/). The aim is to provide a framework 
  to easily integrate and analyze CNV (Copy Number Variants) calling results from multiple algorithms
  and data sources.
