# Simone Montalbano

Hi! I am Simone Montalbano, and this is my personal web page.

I am a researcher in Genomic Psychiatry. My current main research
interest is on methods to call, characterize and validate CNVs
(Copy Number Variants) form SNP array and NGS data.   
[This](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9846-0560) is my ORCID profile, while
[this](https://publons.com/researcher/4849797/simone-montalbano/) 
is my Publons page.

## Interests

My main research interest are data analysis and statistical learning/
machine learning in general. I am particularly into genomic data
because of my training. 


## Education

- I have a Master of Science degree in Cellular and Molecular Biotechnologies.
  I graduated at the University of Trento, Italy, in 2019;

- I did my Bachelor, in Biotechnologies, at the University of Padova, Italy.


## Research Experience

- I am currently a Research Assistant at the Research Institute of Biological
  Psychiatry ([IBP](https://biopsyk.dk/)) in Roskilde, Denmark. I recently started
  a PhD track at the University of Copenhagen ([KU](https://www.ku.dk/english/));

- I have worked as pre-doc fellow for one year (for January 2020 to January 2021)
  in the laboratory of
  [Neurogenomic Biomarkers](https://www.cibio.unitn.it/302/laboratory-of-neurogenomic-biomarkers)
  at CIBIO, Trento, Italy. Here I also did the internship for the Master Thesis 
  (approximately 8 months).


## Projects

- I am the author and maintainer of the R/Bioconductor package
  [CNVgears](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/CNVgears/). The aim is to
  provide a framework to easily integrate and analyse CNV (Copy Number Variants)
  calling results from multiple algorithms and data sources.


## Hobbies

These are some of my main hobbies from the present and the past:

- I am an amateur trail/road runner as well as a road cyclist.
- On my bicycles I like to do all the maintenance work etc. myself,
  in some ways I am an amateur mechanic.
- I love being in nature, in particular in the mountains. Mountaineering,
  going for very long hikes and run in the mountains were my biggest passions
  (before moving to Denmark);
- I really enjoy video games since I was quite young. I don't have a single
  favourite sub-genre, but in general I prefer single player/offline ones.
- I studied sound synthesis and engineering as a side project for
  some years in the past. I haven't touched a synthetiser in a lot of time,
  but haven't lost the passion, who knows.
- I have a minor passion for mechanical keyboards and HiFi audio equipment.
- I have a minor interest in cryptocurrencies and Decentralized Finance in general.
