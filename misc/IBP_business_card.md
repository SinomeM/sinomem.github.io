## Projects

1. **PsychMap**. Recurrent loci in 30 (and possibly more)
   recurrent loci + SCA. Association study with data from iPSYCH
   **and** DST. CNV-GWAS if possible.
2. **Blood Donor Biobank**. Recurrent CNVs, SCA, CNV-GWAS if possible.
   (next future)
2. **Copenhagen Biobank**. Recurrent CNVs, SCA, CNV-GWAS if possible.
   (next future)
3. **BINe** (w/ Kasper Lage). Only manifested my interest on this.
4. **CNV Methods**. New methods to study, validate, filter and
   possibly call from scratch CNVs. 

## Paper

Nothing yet :(

It it ever make it, it would be the small technical note
describing my Bioconductor R package,
[CNVgears](https://master.bioconductor.org/packages/CNVgears/).
I'm quite proud of this work, I sometimes think of it as my
"legitimation" in the path from the bench to Bioinformatics.
